# Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Metal AM

This project uses physics-informed machine learning models and Vision Transformers for segmentation of additive manufacturing data. 

**Since the project is ongoing, this repo currently serves as an MLOps for Research template.**

## Setup Instructions

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in `.devcontainer` with these variables:

```bash
# Get the dataset root from environment variable or use a default
HOST_DATASET_PATH=/path/to/your/dataset
```
