# Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Metal AM

**Since the project is a work-in-progress (WIP), this repo currently serves as an MLOps for Research template.** The aim of this project is to eventually use physics-informed machine learning models and Vision Transformers for segmentation.

## Setup Instructions

### Environment Variables

All that is needed is to create a `.env` file in `.devcontainer` with these variables:

```bash
# Get the dataset root from environment variable or use a default
HOST_DATASET_PATH=/path/to/your/dataset
```

## Status
This is a work-in-progress. Current focus: segmentation using ViT and integrating physics-based features.
